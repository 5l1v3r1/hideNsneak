#basically if there is a state change, handlers 
#can trigger other tasks to run, like a restart

#sample handler use case

# tasks:
# - name: add cache dir 
#   file:
#     path: /opt/cache
#     state: directory

# - name: install nginx
#   apt:
#     name: nginx
#     state: latest
#   notify: restart nginx 

# handlers:
# - name: restart nginx 
#   service: 
#     name: nginx 
#     state: restarted
